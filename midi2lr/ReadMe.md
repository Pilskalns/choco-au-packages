# MIDI2LR

**MIDI2LR** is an application that interfaces MIDI controllers with Lightroom 6+/CC classic. It processes MIDI input into develop parameter updates and photo actions, and sends MIDI output when parameters are changed for motorized feedback (on controllers that have motorized faders). [A listing of available Lightroom commands is in the Wiki](https://github.com/rsjaffe/MIDI2LR/wiki). Assistance on the code and design is welcome.

[See releases for MD5 and SHA checksums](https://github.com/rsjaffe/MIDI2LR/releases). MIDI2LR supports all languages Lightroom supports.

**N!B!** I've only wrapped the original installator into a Chocolatey package. For wiki, tutorials, release notes and any non-choco related problems, please see original GitHub project and forums.
